# Automate hybrid cloud management using ManageIQ and Ansible

Now a days, Automation is the mother of all the inventions, that give rise to all the new technologies. Most of the latest technologies are the reason to automation. This project is one of our try to automate hybrid cloud using ManageIQ and Ansible.

A hybrid cloud is the one with the combination of both i.e. private as well as public cloud with the specified specifications.

ManageIQ is an open source cloud management platform by Red Hat. It is written in Ruby with RoR (Ruby on Rails) as platform. ManageIQ have different releases that will be discussed in [chapter 1.1](chapter1/intro_to_MIQ.md). Fine is a released version of ManageIQ, since then it has supported automation. It also helps to integrate cloud providers like OpenStack.

Although there are many more different providers to be integrated within ManageIQ. But since this project is concerned with infrastructure management of hybrid cloud, OpenStack Provider has been integrated. Yet, users are free to use their required provider as per respective requirements.

OpenStack is a free and open source software platform that is written in Python. OpenStack has different components for variety of different purposes. All these components will be discussed in [chapter 2.1](chapter2/openstack_info.md).

Ansible is software that automates software provisioning, configuration management, and application deployment. Playbooks are Ansibleâ€™s configuration, deployment, and orchestration language. They can describe a policy you want your remote systems to enforce, or a set of steps in a general process to perform. There are two ways to work with Ansible as far as ManageIQ is concerned i.e. Either install Ansible separately from lifecycle or enable Embedded Ansible in ManageIQ. For this project we are going to use Embedded Ansible in ManageIQ.

### About Book
This book is about the automation of hybrid cloud using ManageIQ and Ansible. This book is a guide that helps the person wishing to work towards the automation of hybrid cloud. This will help you understand all the basic installations of the components. It also explains the problems faced with some attributes that will help you know the things better.

The automation helps the globe lead the nation forward and work efficiently. The problem or error faced while working manually are eliminated by the automation procedure that helps to ease the process as well.

### Book Navigation
- [**_Chapter 1_**](chapter1/README.md): This contains the introduction of the important part of project i.e. ManageIQ. ManageIQ installation, its appliance console and basic configuration is also discussed.


- [**_Chapter 2_**](chapter2/README.md): The OpenStack basics are introduced in this chapter. Installation of OpenStack using packstack and its configuration is also mentioned. You may also look for launching an instance in OpenStack and the integration of OpenStack with ManageIQ.
