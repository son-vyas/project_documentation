# Walk to the chapter

OpenStack is a set of software tools that is used for building and managing cloud computing platforms for public and private clouds.The software consists of interrelated components that control the hardware pools of processing, storage and networking resources throughout a data-center.

There are at present two operating systems supporting OpenStack deployment using packstack which is a utility that uses [Puppet](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/5.4/index.html) modules to deploy various parts of OpenStack on multiple pre-installed servers over SSH automatically.
